# Double-Pendulum-Simulation

This py script presents a simulation of the dynamics of a double pendulum system, a classic example of a chaotic dynamical system. The model incorporates the governing equations of motion, accounting for gravitational forces, tension in the pendulum strings, and air resistance. Utilizing numerical integration techniques provided by the SciPy library, the script solves the system's differential equations to predict the evolution of the pendulum's motion over time. The resulting trajectories are visualized using Matplotlib, enabling interactive exploration of the system's behavior by adjusting initial conditions and time parameters. This py script provides insights into the complex nonlinear dynamics inherent in the double pendulum system.
